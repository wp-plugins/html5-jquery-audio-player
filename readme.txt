== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm having problems adding mp3 files - they won't play. =

The plugin supports mp3 and ogg files. You need to upload both an mp3 and ogg version of each track in the playlist. Please also check your files are encoded correctly, and confirm that your file paths are correct. jPlayer sometimes has problems with relative urls so make sure you're using the absolute paths.

= How can I convert my files to mp3 and ogg? =

There are heaps of free conversion tools available - run a search. Personally, I use [Goldwave.](http://www.goldwave.com/)

= Does this work on all browsers? =

Yes. Its designed to work on all major browsers, both PC & Mac, and on mobile devices including iPhone/iPad.

= Is there a way to easliy replace the 'Buy' button with 'Download' button? =

Yes! Set the buy text option to ‘Download’, leave currency field & song price field blank, and set the buy link option on each song to the url of the mp3 or the script that initiates the download.

= Can I use this on a non-WordPress site? =

Yep, sure can. This plugin is just a WordPress version of HTML5 Music Player by Saleem over at [Codebase Hero](http://www.codebasehero.com/2011/06/html-music-player/)

= Can you help me add volume knob, mute function, remove the star rating, add my company’s logo to it, build in functionality to play videos, add a shopping cart module with credit card and PayPal checkout, add a library of 1000 albums including rights for all the music and hand over the code to me for free? =

No. Sorry.

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

If you've tried all the obvious stuff and it's still not working please request support via the forum.
